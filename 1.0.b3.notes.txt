Hatbox 1.0 beta 3 Release Notes

This release is mostly about a major refactoring of the index Node structure.
The cache design of beta 2 proved to have significant problems, so the cache
has been removed. The Node is now just a functional wrapper over a byte array
stored in the database. In a sense the cache has been moved into the database.
Performance testing has revealed that the impact of this change is minimal,
particularly when running JVM in server mode.

There are no API changes, but the index table structure (including the meta-node)
is completely incompatible with beta 2.

Any existing spatial index tables will need to be dropped and the data
tables re-spatialized.

Justin Deoliveira of OpenGeo has started work on a current generation GeoTools
datasource for Hatbox H2. This release of gt-hatbox will be the last from this project,
in future watch out for Hatbox support in GeoTools. Many thanks Justin :-)
